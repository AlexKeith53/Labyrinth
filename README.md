Labyrinth
=========

Simple 2D game where adventurer has to solve a maze

Started working on it on 9th Feb '14. I wanted to create this game for Android (and still do) but considered it easier first to figure out the difficult areas and possible problems via developing it for PC and later port to Android.

Idealistically, game would be multiplayer game with skills and leveling and monsters with different mechanics and various interesting weapons with unique effects.

Currently working:
maze generation with doors locked with keys
monsters exist
boss creature exists
critical path (at least certain number of rooms have to be opened for boss creature to be reached)
monsters and players have skills
monsters' level variation
basic weapons
basic weapon and armour mechanics
teleportation
inventory
food works
simple loot mechanics
and some more things...

Todo:
player levelup
variation in room types
room object implementation
...
